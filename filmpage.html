				<th>This was an improvised, completely unscripted experimental film and my first directed film. I cut the original movie down to half the length two years later in order to make a tighter, more cohesive piece</th>

				<th>This was my second movie and very much a successor to PokerPalooza!. It was filmed in the same time frame, had lots of improvised moments. Unlike the last movie, however, it had an actual script and is a little less wall to wall silliness</th>

				<th><span class="special text">The movie that I wanted to make for three years, this project was incredibly difficult and was delayed repeatedly (the previous two films being made instead because this project fell through). It is easily the most polished and most styled as it had far more planning than the others, but was only half finished due to difficulties on set. The final product is an edit made to preserve the original story. While I love the polish, I don't think it stands as my last film</p></span></th>
